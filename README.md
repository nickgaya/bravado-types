# bravado-types

Tool to generate MyPy type stubs for Bravado-generated classes to support
static type checking.

## Motivation

[Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/Bravado) is a Python client library for
interacting with APIs defined by Swagger 2.0 schemas. Bravado parses a given
API schema at runtime and dynamically generates classes to represent the data
types defined by the schema. This is a nice Pythonic approach, but it means
that static type-checking tools like MyPy have limited ability to type-check
code that uses Bravado since the attributes and method signatures of objects
generated by Bravado are not known until runtime.

Bravado-types addresses this problem by pre-generating type information about
the generated data for a given schema at build time. Using the generated type
stubs, MyPy can statically detect errors such as calling a nonexistent
operation method on a resource, failing to specify a required operation
parameter, or assigning a wrongly-typed value to a model attribute. This allows
for a much higher level of confidence in the correctness of code that uses
Bravado clients than would otherwise be possible.

The validity of this approach relies on the assumption that the same version of
the schema is used during code generation as at runtime.  Without this
assumption it is nearly impossible to make any useful assertions about the
runtime behavior of generated clients.

## Installation

    pip install bravado-types

To install the latest master version directly from GitHub:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/nickgaya/bravado-types.git

## Usage

### Code generation

To start using bravado-types, invoke the CLI against your Swagger schema of
choice:

    bravado-types --url 'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json' \
        --name PetStore --path petstore.py

This command will download the PetStore example schema and generate a Python 3
module, *petstore.py*, along with a MyPy stub file *petstore.pyi*, for that
schema. The generated module and stub file can then be used in your package.
The generated code only depends on bravado, not on bravado-types, so you do not
need to include the latter as a runtime package dependency.

Code generation can also be done programmatically.

    from bravado import SwaggerClient
    from bravado_types import RenderConfig, generate_module

    client = SwaggerClient.from_url(
        "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json")
    config = RenderConfig(name='PetStore', path='petstore.py')
    generate_module(client, config)

Bravado-types supports several optional parameters to customize code
generation. See the `bravado_types.render.RenderConfig` docstring or the CLI
help output (`bravado-types --help`) for details.

### Using the generated module

To create a type-aware client, import the relevant name from the generated
module and use its `from_url()` or `from_spec()` method to create an instance.

    from petstore import PetStoreClient

    client = PetStoreClient.from_url(
        "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json")
    reveal_type(client)  # petstore.PetStoreClient

You can use the client like a regular Bravado client to instantiate model
objects and make API calls with them.

    Pet = client.get_model('Pet')
    reveal_type(Pet)  # Type[petstore.Pet]

    frank = Pet(name='Frank', photoUrls=[])
    reveal_type(frank)  # petstore.Pet

    pet123 = client.pet.getPetById(id=123).response().result
    reveal_type(pet123)  # petstore.Pet

The generated module also provides importable types for use in type
annotations.

    from petstore import Pet as TPet

    def get_name(pet: TPet) -> str:
        reveal_type(pet)  # petstore.Pet
        return pet.name

Generated model, resource, and operation types are only used for static type
checking and must not be used for runtime interactions.

    # Placeholder for static type-checking
    from petstore import Pet as TPet

    # Use placeholder for type annotations and casts
    pet: TPet = ...
    typing.cast(TPet, ...)

    # Runtime model class
    Pet = client.get_model('Pet')

    # Use runtime class for model instantiation and runtime type checks
    pet = Pet(name='Boots', photoUrls=[])
    assert isinstance(pet, Pet)

## Caveats

### Operation response types

Operations often have multiple different response schemas for different status
codes, which presents an obstacle to static type analysis.  Bravado-types
offers three different options for response type annotations, specified by the
`response_types` configuration parameter.

* `'success'`: The response type will be declared as the union of all response
  types with 2xx status. This is unsound, but may be useful if you are primarily
  concerned with responses when the request was successful.

* `'union'`: The response type will be declared as the union of all response
  types defined in the schema. This is probably the most correct but is
  cumbersome, as the developer must perform manual type checks or casts to
  obtain a useable type.

* `'any'`: The response type will be declared as `Any`. This gives maximum
  flexibility but requires the developer to manually add type hints if they
  want any type checking on the result of an operation.

By default, bravado-types uses the `'success'` option as it is felt to be the
most pragmatic option, although the least sound.

### Array types

Bravado allows either lists or tuples for values with `type: array` in the
Swagger schema. We can represent this precisely in type stubs as
`Union[List[T], Tuple[T, ...]]` but this is somewhat cumbersome. Another
alternative would be to use `Sequence[T]`, but this has the downside that MyPy
considers `str` a subtype of `Sequence[str]` and `bytes` a subtype of
`Sequence[int]`.  A third alternative would be to use `List[T]`. This is more
restrictive than necessary, but also simpler.

We provide a configuration parameter, `array_types` to specify the desired
behavior. The default is `'list'`.

### Custom formats

If bravado-types encounters a primitive type spec with an unrecognized 'format'
property, it emits a warning and assigning the variable a type based on the
'type' property alone.

Future versions of this tool may add support for custom user-defined formats.

### Model inheritance

Swagger allows composing model definitions with the `allOf` schema property.
This can be interpreted as a subclass relationship between models. Bravado
implements this to some extent in its model metaclass,
`bravado_core.model.ModelMeta`.

By default, bravado-types does not mirror this implied type hierarchy in its
generated types.  To enable this functionality, set the `model_inheritance`
configuration parameter to `True`.

### Additional model properties

Bravado-types does not currently support accessing or setting additional
properties as attributes of model instances. If you need to set or access
additional properties, you can use dict-like syntax instead.

For example, given this model schema...

    x-model: APModel
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: int

...you can add a property called "something" like this:

    model = APModel()
    model['something'] = 123

MyPy will not type-check additional properties.

### File parameters and responses

Bravado's handling of parameters and responses with `type: file` is
complicated.  This tool simply annotates such values with the `Any` type.

## Development

This project uses Tox to manage virtual environments for unit tests and other
self-checks.  Unit tests are written with the Pytest framework.
